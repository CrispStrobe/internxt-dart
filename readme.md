# Internxt CLI - Dart Edition üéØ

[](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

A command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Internxt cloud storage, implemented in Dart. This is nothing official from Internxt and still a work in progress, so use at your own risk, and do not expect everything to work perfectly.

This tool allows you to manage your Internxt Drive files and folders directly from your terminal, including uploads, downloads, listing, moving, renaming, and trash operations. It also includes a **WebDAV server** to mount your Internxt Drive as a local disk.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Authentication:** Login/logout securely, with **automatic session refresh**.
  * **WebDAV Server:** Mount your Internxt Drive as a local disk on macOS, Windows, or Linux.
  * **File Management:** List, upload, download, move, rename files and folders.
  * **Path-Based Operations:** Interact with your drive using familiar file paths (e.g., `/Documents/report.pdf`).
  * **Search & Discovery:**
      * Server-side fuzzy search (`search`).
      * Recursive, pattern-based file search (`find`).
      * Visual directory `tree` command.
  * **Performance:** **Local caching** for folder contents dramatically speeds up navigation and repeated commands.
  * **Resilience:** **Resumable uploads/downloads** (via batch state) and automatic retries on 5xx server errors.
  * **Trash Management:** List trash contents, move items to trash, delete permanently, and restore items.
  * **Recursive Operations:** Upload and download entire directory structures.
  * **Conflict Handling:** Choose whether to overwrite or skip existing files.
  * **Timestamp Preservation:** Option to preserve original file modification times during uploads/downloads.
  * **Filtering:** Include or exclude files based on patterns during uploads/downloads.
  * **Cross-Platform:** Runs wherever the Dart SDK is available.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Install Dart SDK:** Follow the instructions on the [official Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/internxt-dart.git
    cd internxt-dart
    ```
3.  **Get Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    dart pub get
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

All commands are run using the Dart executable:

```bash
dart cli.dart <command> [arguments...] [options...]
```

Example:

```bash
# List files
dart cli.dart list /Documents --uuids

# Upload a file and preserve its timestamp
dart cli.dart upload file.txt --target /Documents -p

# Download a file by its path
dart cli.dart download-path /Documents/file.txt

# Find all PDFs on your drive
dart cli.dart find / "*.pdf"

# Start the WebDAV server
dart cli.dart webdav-start
```
