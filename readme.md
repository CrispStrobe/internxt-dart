[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

A command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Internxt cloud storage, implemented in Dart and designed to be compatible with the functionality of an internal Python blueprint. This is nothing offical from Internxt and still work in progress, so use at your own risk, and do not expect everything to work perfectly!

This tool allows you to manage your Internxt Drive files and folders directly from your terminal, including uploads, downloads, listing, moving, renaming, and trash operations.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Authentication:** Login/logout securely.
* **File Management:** List, upload, download, move, rename files and folders.
* **Path-Based Operations:** Interact with your drive using familiar file paths (e.g., `/Documents/report.pdf`).
* **Trash Management:** List trash contents, move items to trash, delete permanently, and restore items.
* **Recursive Operations:** Upload and download entire directory structures.
* **Conflict Handling:** Choose whether to overwrite or skip existing files during uploads/downloads.
* **Wildcard Support:** Use `*` and `?` for uploading multiple files (via shell expansion).
* **Timestamp Preservation:** Option to preserve original file modification times during uploads/downloads.
* **Filtering:** Include or exclude files based on patterns during uploads/downloads.
* **Cross-Platform:** Runs wherever the Dart SDK is available.
